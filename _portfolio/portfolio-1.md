During my second year at the University of Nottingham, I had the opportunity to lead a group of six other students on a year-long project. This was run in collaboration with the Food Science department.

We were tasked with developing a web application that provided Food Science students with an output of relevant careers, based on their inputted data. This project was nominated for the best second year project (graded at 90%), and the tool is live in numerous universities across the country. The application is responsive and written in PHP and JavaScript, interfacing with an SQL database.
