I am a PhD Researcher at The University of Manchester working at the boundary of **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Machine Learning**. 

Thus far, my research has focused on designing, developing, and evaluating accessibility technologies for visually impaired users. Specifically, I am producing an **unsupervised learning approach** to **cluster web pages by similarity**. This significantly reduces how many pages accessibility auditors need to review. 

Before my PhD at The University of Manchester, I achieved a First Class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham. In addition, I have strong software engineering skills acquired through my degree and two software engineering internships: one focused on accessibility, the other on software engineering in research.

As I approach the end of my PhD, I am seeking research opportunities at the intersection of HCI and AI.
