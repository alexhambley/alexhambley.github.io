Hi! I am currently a **Senior Research Software Engineer** at The University of Manchester. 

## PhD
I am currently finishing up my **PhD** from the University of Manchester. Based in the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/facilities/iam-lab/" target="_blank">Interaction Analysis and Modelling laboratory</a>, my research focuses on **Human-Centered AI**, particularly in the context of hybrid interaction. 

Specifically, my work optimises web accessibility technologies for visually impaired users. My work has produced an unsupervised machine learning approach that clusters web pages to assist accessibility auditors, and significantly improves web accessibility evaluation time. For more information, my <a href="/publications/">publications are available here</a>.

Before my PhD at The University of Manchester, I achieved a First Class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham.

## Past Experience
Previously, I was a Software Engineer at the <a href="https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research/consumer-data-research-centre/" target="_blank">Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC)</a>. Part of the **Leeds Institute for Data Analytics**, the CDRC is a big data initiative run by the Universities of Leeds, Liverpool, Oxford, and UCL.

I was an **Associate Lecturer** at the Open University, where I taught <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269" target="_blank">Algorithms, Data Structures and Computability</a>. 

I was also full-stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.horlix.com" target="_blank">HeX Productions</a>, a web accessibility consultancy based in Nottingham, and a Research Software Engineer at  <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/" target="_blank">The University of Twente</a>, working on social robot prototypes. I have also taught on several modules at the University of Manchester, including **Programming**, **User Experience** and **Databases**.
