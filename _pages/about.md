I am a **PhD Researcher** in the **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderhambley/" target="_blank">Interaction Analysis and Modelling laboratory</a>** at the University of Manchester. My research focuses on web accessibility technologies for visually impaired users. Specifically, I am producing an unsupervised machine learning approach that clusters web pages by similarity, significantly improving web accessibility evaluation time.

Before my PhD at The University of Manchester, I achieved a First Class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham.

I am also an **Associate Lecturer** at the Open University on the <b><a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269" target="_blank">Algorithms, Data Structures and Computability</a></b> course, and a postgraduate teaching assistant for several modules at the University of Manchester, including **Programming**,** User Experience** and **Databases**.
