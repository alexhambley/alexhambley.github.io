I am currently a **Software Engineer** at the <a href="https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research/consumer-data-research-centre/" target="_blank">Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC)</a>, a big data initiative run by the Universities of Leeds, Liverpool, Oxford, and UCL. 

## PhD

I am currently finishing up my **PhD** from the University of Manchester. Based in the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/facilities/iam-lab/" target="_blank">Interaction Analysis and Modelling laboratory</a>, my research focuses on **Human-Centered AI**, particularly in the context of hybrid interaction. Specifically, my work optimises web accessibility technologies for visually impaired users by producing an unsupervised machine learning approach that clusters web pages to assist accessibility auditors and significantly improve web accessibility evaluation time. For more information, you can see my <a href="/publications/">publications</a>.

Before my PhD at The University of Manchester, I achieved a First Class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham.

## Teaching

I am an **Associate Lecturer** at the Open University on the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269" target="_blank">Algorithms, Data Structures and Computability</a> course. 

## Past Experience

Previously, I was a full-stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.horlix.com" target="_blank">HeX Productions</a>, a web accessibility consultancy based in Nottingham, and a Research Software Engineer at  <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/" target="_blank">The University of Twente</a>, working on social robot prototypes. I have alsotaught on several modules at the University of Manchester, including **Programming**, **User Experience** and **Databases**.
