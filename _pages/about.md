I am a PhD Researcher at The University of Manchester working at the boundary of **Human-Computer Interaction** (HCI) and **applied machine learning**. As I finish my PhD, I am seeking Software Engineering or Data Scientist opportunities. 

I am an Associate Lecturer at the Open University on the **Algorithms, Data Structures and Computability** course. I am also a Graduate Instructor for **User Experience** at the University of Manchester. 

Part of the **Interaction Analysis and Modelling** laboratory, my research focuses on accessibility technologies for visually impaired users. I am producing an unsupervised machine learning approach that clusters web pages by similarity, significantly improving web accessibility evaluation time. 

Before my PhD at The University of Manchester, I achieved a **First Class BSc (Hons)** in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham. In addition, I have strong software engineering skills acquired through my degree and two software engineering internships: one focused on accessibility, the other on software engineering in research.
