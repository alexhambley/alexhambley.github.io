# excerpt: 'The Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is a methodology that guides an auditor through evaluating a website's conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In this paper, we raise some concerns present in the five stages of the WCAG-EM, including the evaluative scope, the non-probabilistic sampling approach, and the potential for bias within the selected sample. We propose a novel framework positioned parallel to the WCAG-EM, but with additional statistical-based metrics to address these concerns. These metrics consider the coverage, representativeness, complexity, popularity, freshness, and accessibility of a population of pages. We provide an overview of these metrics and discuss the possible use with three web page population-sourcing methods: server log files, breadth-first crawling, and depth-first crawling. Finally, we highlight the potential of utilising server log files as a population-sourcing method.'

Web accessibility evaluation is costly and complex due to limited time, resources and ambiguity. We aim to reduce the number of pages auditors must review, and optimise the evaluation process, by employing statistically representative pages. This minimises a site of thousands of pages to a manageable review of archetypal pages using clustering, and significantly reduces the number of pages an auditor must review as they will inspect a page representative of the others in their cluster. Collectively, these clusters are representative of the pages in the target population. To support this, we introduce a framework of six metrics: coverage, representativeness, complexity, popularity, freshness and accessibility. This framework is supported by an accessibility tool divided into three stages: an initial step focused on crawling and downloading pages to run preliminary clustering. The second step calculates the complexity of the population, and the third stage calculates the sample size and produces a final report. Our approach significantly reduces the number of pages an auditor must review, as they will inspect a page representative of the others in their cluster. Collectively, these clusters are statistically representative of the pages in the target population.
