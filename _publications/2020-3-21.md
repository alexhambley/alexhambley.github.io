title: "Empirical web accessibility evaluation for blind web users"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-3-21
excerpt: 'The project intends to produce a novel, accurate and holistic system that assesses the accessibility of an entire website based on a sample of webpages. The project also strives to bring statistical rigour to the sampling and clustering of webpages. By orchestrating pre-existing evaluative tools, alongside developer testing, we can produce a combined accessibility assessment. A major benefit to the accessibility field is the effective, large-scale evaluation of large websites. The approach strives to improve automated testing coverage by combining evaluative tools, and minimise inaccuracy through effective clustering and sampling.'
