# excerpt: 'The Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is a methodology that guides an auditor through evaluating a website's conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In this paper, we raise some concerns present in the five stages of the WCAG-EM, including the evaluative scope, the non-probabilistic sampling approach, and the potential for bias within the selected sample. We propose a novel framework positioned parallel to the WCAG-EM, but with additional statistical-based metrics to address these concerns. These metrics consider the coverage, representativeness, complexity, popularity, freshness, and accessibility of a population of pages. We provide an overview of these metrics and discuss the possible use with three web page population-sourcing methods: server log files, breadth-first crawling, and depth-first crawling. Finally, we highlight the potential of utilising server log files as a population-sourcing method.'

Web accessibility evaluation is a costly and complex process due to limited time, resources and ambiguity. To optimise the accessibility evaluation process, we aim to reduce the number of pages audi- tors must review by employing statistically representative pages, reducing a site of thousands of pages to a manageable review of archetypal pages. Our paper focuses on representativeness, one of six proposed metrics that form our methodology, to address the limitations we have identified with the W3C Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM). These include the evaluative scope, the non-probabilistic sampling approach, and the potential for bias within the selected sample. Representative- ness, in particular, is a metric to assess the quality and coverage of sampling. To measure this, we systematically evaluate five web page representations with a website of 388 pages, including tags, structure, the DOM tree, content, and a mixture of structure and content. Our findings highlight the importance of including struc- tural components in representations. We validate our conclusions using the same methodology for three additional random sites of 500 pages. As an exclusive attribute, we find that features derived from web content are suboptimal and can lead to lower quality and more disparate clustering for optimised accessibility evaluation.
